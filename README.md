# Bus-Reservation-System
Basically four features are available in this project. Here, I am going to briefly describe the features:

Install Bus Information:
This feature allows you to install a typical bus information before it can be reserved by the passengers or shown in buses available. It includes the bus no., driver’s name, arrival time, departure time and destination (from and to) of the bus.
Reservation:
This feature is very simple; it includes the bus no., seat number and the passenger’s name. The seat number of the particular bus is reserved under the passenger’s name.
Show Reservation Information:
With this feature, you can show all the information regarding the buses and their respective seats. It contains all the information stored by the previous two function of this project. It also enlists the no. of empty seats in a bus along with the seat number registered to a particular passenger. (Scroll down to view the output screen of this feature.)
Buses Available:
This feature simply shows the buses available for reservation, and the information regarding the bus no. stored under the first feature.
In bus reservation system project, file has not been used to store the data of bus information. So, upon every run of the program, previously stored data regarding the aforementioned features are lost.
